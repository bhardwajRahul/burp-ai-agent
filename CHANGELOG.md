### Changed

- **Duplicate Issue Logic Consolidation**:
  - Replaced duplicated issue matching/canonicalization code in Passive Scanner, Active Scanner, MCP tools, and UI actions with `IssueUtils`.
- **Shutdown Reliability and Consistency**:
  - Refactored `App.shutdown()` to use a unified safe shutdown step wrapper with consistent error handling.
  - Added redaction mapping cleanup to app shutdown flow.
- **Text Sanitization Performance**:
  - Cached regex patterns in `IssueText` to avoid recompilation on each call.
- **Passive Scanner Request Filtering and Deduplication**:
  - Added pre-AI traffic pruning for low-value responses (204/304, static assets, tiny bodies without interesting headers).
  - Added endpoint-path and response-fingerprint dedup windows to avoid repeated analysis of equivalent traffic.
- **Passive Scanner Prompt Compaction**:
  - Replaced full-header forwarding with security-focused header filtering (allowlist + noise denylist + custom `x-*` handling).
  - Reduced parameter verbosity and removed cache-busting parameters from AI metadata.
  - Added content-aware body compaction (JSON array sampling + HTML head/form/inline-script extraction).
  - Updated passive scanner base prompt to a compact, evidence-first schema while preserving strict JSON output constraints.
- **Context Collection Payload Size Control**:
  - `ContextCollector` now supports body truncation controls and compact JSON output to reduce manual action token usage.
  - Context menu actions now pass context size/compact settings from `AgentSettings` instead of relying on implicit defaults.
- **HTTP Backend Conversation Trimming**:
  - Conversation history trimming now enforces both message count and total character budget to prevent prompt blow-up in long sessions.
- **BountyPrompt Context Limits**:
  - Reduced default tag/chunk limits and added category-specific bounds to lower prompt size while keeping actionable context.
- **Passive Scanner Settings UX**:
  - Expanded AI Passive Scanner tab with advanced token/performance controls and live runtime application of optimization settings.
- **Backend Health Status Presentation**:
  - Main tab backend badge now supports richer status transitions (`AI: OK`, `AI: Degraded`, `AI: Offline`) with explanatory tooltips.
- **Supervisor Health Flow**:
  - Backend health resolution now routes through backend registry health contracts with compatibility fallback to availability checks.
- **HTTP Backend Client Lifecycle**:
  - HTTP backends now reuse shared `OkHttpClient` instances keyed by backend URL/timeout and close pools centrally on shutdown.
- **Token Estimation Accuracy**:
  - Token estimates now use backend-specific calibration factors and mix real usage values with estimated remainder when available.
- **CI Gate Strategy**:
  - PR pipeline now uses a fast verification gate (`test -PexcludeHeavyTests=true`) while preserving heavy suites for nightly runs.
- **Architecture and README References**:
  - Updated architecture and README docs to include schema migration behavior and operator playbook links.
- **Ollama context limit**:
  - Updated default Ollama Max Context Window to 256000.

### Fixed

- **Backend Registry Cache Lifecycle**:
  - Fixed `availabilityCache` lifecycle by clearing it on `reload()` and `shutdown()`.
  - Fixed initialization-order safety so cache is always available during startup/reload.
- **Repeated Passive AI Cost on Equivalent Traffic**:
  - Fixed repeated backend invocations for semantically identical passive traffic by combining endpoint/fingerprint dedup with prompt-result caching.
- **Unbounded Manual Context Growth**:
  - Fixed manual context actions sending oversized request/response payloads and pretty-printed JSON by introducing truncation + compact encoding.
- **Long-Session Prompt Inflation (HTTP Backends)**:
  - Fixed runaway history growth by adding total-character trimming in conversation history management.
- **HTTP Backend Client Churn**:
  - Fixed repeated per-request HTTP client construction that prevented efficient connection reuse.
- **Legacy Settings Drift**:
  - Fixed legacy preference normalization for MCP allowed origins and old Gemini default command values during migration.

- **Passive Scanner Concurrency/Startup Flow**:
  - Replaced one-time registration and backend startup flags with atomic control.
  - Replaced fixed startup sleep with bounded readiness polling.
  - Replaced response wait busy-loop with latch-based completion waiting.

- **Settings Type Safety**: Migrated scanner settings from raw strings to enums (`SeverityLevel`, `PayloadRisk`, `ScanMode`) with compatibility-preserving load/save behavior.
- **HTTP Backends Refactor**: Ollama, LM Studio and OpenAI-compatible backends now use shared HTTP/retry/history support for reduced duplication and more consistent behavior.
- **Settings UI Modularization**: `SettingsPanel` now delegates section rendering to dedicated panel classes (`Backend`, `Passive`, `Active`, `MCP`, `Prompt`, `Privacy`, `Help`) for maintainability.
- **Context Menu Active Scan UX**:
  - Added explicit confirmation dialogs before active testing.
  - Added target validation and queue status visibility (current/max queue).
  - Added clearer warnings when targets are filtered or queue is full.

### Fixed

- **History Management**: Implemented proper conversation history handling for CLI backends to simulate session continuity.
- **Claude CLI Prompt Limits**: Implemented file-based prompt passing for large inputs (>32k chars). Prompts exceeding the limit are now written to a temporary file which Claude is instructed to read, completely bypassing shell argument/STDIN size limits and preventing "Prompt is too long" errors without data loss.
- **Thread-Safety and Shutdown Reliability**:
  - Active scanner stop path now force-cancels and awaits termination.
  - Supervisor lifecycle transitions are lock-protected for safer start/stop/restart behavior.
  - Main tab timers are explicitly stopped on extension shutdown.
