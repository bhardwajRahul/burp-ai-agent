/**
 * REL-07 / SC5 — the live-file registry for CLI subprocess temp files, plus the single JVM exit hook
 * that sweeps it (CONTEXT.md D-01 through D-04).
 *
 * It replaces the JDK's `File.deleteOnExit()` facility, which `CliBackend` used to call once per CLI
 * invocation. That facility keeps its registrations in a static set with no removal API, so every
 * invocation retained one path string for the life of the Burp JVM — growth bounded by lifetime
 * invocation count, which is unbounded in a long session (threat T-24-15).
 *
 * Guarantees:
 *  - `CliBackend`'s `finally` block remains the PRIMARY cleanup path for both temp files, on the
 *    normal path and on the exception path. It deletes each file and clears its entry here. This
 *    object changes nothing about that; it is a genuine safety net, not a replacement.
 *  - The one case the net uniquely covers is a clean Burp quit while a CLI call is in flight: the
 *    `finally` has not run yet, and the JVM exit hook armed here deletes what is still registered.
 *  - [drain] and the `finally` block may both run for the same file. A double delete is expected and
 *    must never surface as an error.
 *
 * Bound:
 *  The set holds at most one entry per IN-FLIGHT CLI call — normally zero or one, since a CLI call
 *  creates at most one prompt file and at most one codex output file and both are deregistered when
 *  the call ends. The bound is therefore concurrency, not lifetime invocation count. That is the whole
 *  of D-01's argument: the same crash-time coverage, with a set that returns to empty.
 *
 * Window NOT closed:
 *  A registry that lives in JVM memory cannot reap a file orphaned by SIGKILL or by power loss,
 *  because on those paths neither the `finally` block nor any exit hook runs (D-04, threat T-24-06).
 *  The residual is at most one temp file per in-flight call, left in the OS temp directory, which the
 *  OS reaps on its own schedule; the prompt file also keeps its owner-only POSIX permissions, which is
 *  the compensating control. A bounded prefix sweep at extension load was considered and rejected in
 *  D-04, because a second concurrent Burp instance can legitimately own live files under the same
 *  prefixes. Separately: entries the JDK facility already accumulated inside a Burp process that is
 *  running right now cannot be undone by this change — SC5 is about future invocations — so inspecting
 *  a long-running Burp session is not a way to verify this fix.
 *
 * Why the hook must be removed on unload:
 *  The hook armed here is a class loaded by the extension's own classloader, so a hook that is never
 *  unregistered pins a dead classloader on every extension reload, and re-arms a second one on the
 *  next load (threat T-24-07). This is a property of THIS hook specifically, and not of the JDK
 *  facility being removed, which retained plain path strings and pinned nothing. [shutdown] is called
 *  from `App.shutdown()`, which is also the only thing that covers a CLI call still in flight when the
 *  extension is unloaded while Burp keeps running — the JVM exit hook does not fire on unload.
 *
 * Visibility: `internal` so `CliBackendTempFileTest` can drive every path in pure JVM without a
 * subprocess and without reflecting into `java.base`. That assertability is the reason D-02 put the
 * registry in its own file rather than in a private companion inside `CliBackend`. Not part of the
 * backend's public surface.
