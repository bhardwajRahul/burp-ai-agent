/**
 * The single place chat work leaves the AWT Event Dispatch Thread, and the single place it returns.
 *
 * REL-05: a tool call reaches Burp through `api.http()`, which must not be entered from the EDT, and
 * which freezes the whole Burp UI for as long as it runs there. [run] takes the work off the EDT onto
 * a short-lived **named daemon** thread and marshals its outcome back through exactly ONE
 * `SwingUtilities.invokeLater` — the `MainTab.kt:190-215` idiom, with the daemon flag that idiom omits.
 *
 * **After the dispatch statement, nothing here waits on the worker.** The counter-example lives in this
 * repo: `MontoyaHttpTransport.execute` offloads and then blocks the calling thread on the worker's
 * result, which dodges Burp's EDT exception while leaving the UI just as frozen. Offloading and
 * freeing the UI are two different things, and only the second is what REL-05 asks for.
 *
 * Concurrency is `java.util.concurrent` plus JDK Swing, per CONVENTIONS.md:95 (no other concurrency
 * layer outside the `mcp` package) and D-05 (no panel-owned executor pool).
 *
 * The `Result<T>` crosses the thread boundary **intact**: the EDT tail needs the real `Throwable`, not
 * a stringified one, because `ChatPanel.reportFailedToolCall` keys its SC3 `errorClass` field off the
 * throwable's own class.

     * observers and in the error log — callers pass a trace id, so an ordering assertion can select by
     * identity instead of by list position.
     *
     * [logError] is the caller's error sink (`api.logging().logToError`). A worker throwing on a thread
     * Burp did not create is a throwable nobody would otherwise see, so both the work and the EDT tail
     * are wrapped and routed to it.
     *
     * **Every sink on the path to the single `invokeLater` is itself wrapped, so the resulting contract
     * is that the EDT tail is unreachable only if `SwingUtilities.invokeLater` itself fails (CR-04).**
     * `logError` is a Montoya API handle at every production call site, and a handle whose extension has
     * been unloaded is not guaranteed to keep accepting calls — which is exactly the co-occurring
     * condition here, since the failure-path sink is reached only when `work` failed and one reason
     * `work` fails is that the extension is tearing down. Unwrapped, a throwing logger killed the
     * runnable outright: the tail never ran, so `ChatPanel` never cleared its busy state, `runningTool`
     * kept a token nobody would clear, the completion callback was silently dropped, and the panel sat
     * in UI-SPEC state S3 — Send hidden, input disabled — for the rest of the Burp session with nothing
     * running. A throwing sink must cost a log line and nothing else.
     *
     * [dispatchedObserver] is deliberately NOT wrapped, and that asymmetry is a decision rather than an
     * oversight. It is invoked on the CALLING thread before any dispatch exists, so nothing downstream
     * depends on it and a throw there is the caller's own bug — one that must stay visible instead of
     * being swallowed inside a helper. Wrapping it would buy nothing and hide something.
     *
     * The daemon flag is set explicitly: a non-daemon worker can hold extension unload open. The thread
     * is named so a stuck worker is identifiable in a thread dump.
