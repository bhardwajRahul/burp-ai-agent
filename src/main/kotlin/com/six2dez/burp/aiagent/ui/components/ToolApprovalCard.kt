/**
 * Applies the UI-SPEC §Typography overflow contract: an `<html>` prefix at offset 0, which is what makes

 *
 * A plain `JLabel` does not wrap, and `BasicLabelUI.getMinimumSize` returns its PREFERRED size for one,
 * so an unwrapped caption row sets a hard floor under the whole card. Measured on Temurin 21 headless
 * at Dialog-12: row 10 drops from a 625 px minimum to 55 px with the prefix, and row 2's CONFIRM_EACH
 * reason from 450 px to 71 px. Without them the card could not shrink below 644 px inside a transcript
 * that sets `HORIZONTAL_SCROLLBAR_NEVER` (`ChatPanel.SessionPanel`), so dragging the sessions divider
 * right pushed `Approve for session` off the viewport edge with no scrollbar, no wrap and no
 * affordance — a security control the user could not reach (22-UI-REVIEW.md S-1). The other half of
 * that fix is the `minimumSize` floor `MainTab` puts on `ChatPanel.root`.
 *
 * Applied ONLY to extension-authored copy with no interpolation of any kind, which is why it takes an
 * already-composed string rather than a template: no model byte can reach offset 0, or any other
 * offset, in what is passed here. That is the same exemption [footerTextFor] documents, and
 * `ToolApprovalCardTest` enumerates every row allowed to carry the renderer and re-asserts the
 * no-model-byte property on each rather than exempting `JLabel` as a class.
 *
 * **Residual, recorded rather than discovered later.** An HTML `JLabel` reports the preferred height of
 * its UNCONSTRAINED layout, so between the card's new floor and its ~625 px preferred width these two
 * captions wrap to a second line while `SessionPanel.addComponent`'s height-capping wrapper still
 * allocates one, and the second line is clipped. That is a strictly better failure than the one it
 * replaces — the four decision buttons stay reachable at every reachable width, and the spec's
 * safe-action-first ordering keeps `Deny` the last control to be lost — but it is a trade, not a free
 * win. Fixing it properly needs a width-aware `getPreferredSize` override, which was judged too much

/**
 * The SEC-06 decision surface: an inline card in the chat transcript that shows one model-emitted tool

 *
 * **The hard problem this component solves is not layout — it is that two classes of text share one
 * card.** The heading, the catalog title, the tier badge and the button labels are extension-derived
 * and trustworthy. The tool ID and the args JSON are model-supplied and an injected prompt can write
 * "safe routine read" into either. A user must tell them apart WITHOUT reading carefully, so:
 *
 * - **Containment (primary).** Every model-supplied string is rendered inside a bordered, input-styled
 *   region, and nothing extension-derived is ever rendered inside one.
 * - **Widget class (anti-spoofing).** Model text goes ONLY into [JTextField] / [JTextArea]. It is
 *   forbidden in [JLabel], any `AbstractButton`, any `JEditorPane`, and any tooltip: all of those route
 *   their text through `BasicHTML.updateRenderer`, so `"<html><b>Approved</b>"` in a tool ID would
 *   render as extension-looking chrome. `ToolApprovalCardTest` asserts this mechanically through
 *   `getClientProperty("html")`.
 * - **Font family (theme-independent).** Extension text is proportional; model text is monospace.
 * - **An explicit label.** A caption above the first model region says this extension did not write
 *   what follows. It sits outside every box, so model text physically cannot escape into it.
 *
 * The card is also a **record**, not just a prompt: it stays in the transcript after the decision and
 * must read unambiguously months later.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT an `ActionCard` subclass. `ActionCard` renders all four of its text fields into
 * `JLabel`s, which is the one thing this card may never do; it also uses the legacy theme shim, a
 * nested scroll pane, off-grid insets, and has no `updateUI()` override.
