// ReDoS-safe regex utility.
//
// The JDK Matcher has no built-in timeout (JDK-8234713 "Won't fix"). This object bounds any
// single regex match to ~50 ms by wrapping the input in a DeadlineCharSequence whose get()
// throws RegexTimeoutException once System.nanoTime() exceeds the deadline. The Matcher reads
// input characters via CharSequence.get() during backtracking, so the deadline is observed
// promptly even under catastrophic backtracking.
//
// Reference: https://www.ocpsoft.org/regex/how-to-interrupt-a-long-running-infinite-java-regular-expression/
// [CITED — interruptible-CharSequence idiom, adapted to use a nanoTime deadline instead of
//  Thread.interrupted() so it works without requiring external thread management.]
//
// Design decisions mirrored from SecretCipher.kt:
//   - fail-soft: never throw into the redaction pipeline; return a safe fallback.
//   - no ExecutorService: avoids orphaned threads in Burp's long-lived JVM process.
//   - AWT-free: no java.awt / javax.swing imports so Phase 15's scanner-side tripwire can reuse
//     this file headless.

// Thrown by DeadlineCharSequence.get() when the match deadline is exceeded.

    // (PRIV-02) WR-07 / T-21-63: the catastrophic-backtracking probe corpus for isPatternSafe.
    //
    // WHY THIS IS A SECURITY CONTROL AND NOT A TIDY-UP. Before this phase, a custom pattern that
    // was accepted but slow degraded gracefully: custom patterns ran only inside the redactTokens
    // branch and an overrunning one was simply skipped. D-05 changed both halves of that. Custom
    // patterns now run in EVERY privacy mode INCLUDING OFF (they are a "never send this, ever" list,
    // independent of the mode — see Redaction.bodyRules), and bodyStage now fails CLOSED. So an
    // accepted-but-slow pattern no longer degrades: it spends Defaults.MAX_REDACTION_BUDGET_MS and
    // drops real content behind markers on EVERY call, including the calls a user in OFF mode
    // believes are unfiltered. The blast radius of a bad accept grew in both directions during this
    // phase without the gate being strengthened. This corpus is the strengthening.
    //
    // THE DESIGN PRINCIPLE IS (CHARACTER CLASS x TERMINATOR), and the terminator half is the part
    // WR-07 missed. Catastrophic backtracking in the (X+)+L family needs a long run of X that is
    // NOT followed by L, so the match fails and the engine explores the run's partitions. WR-07
    // proposed varying only the character class, all four probes still ending in '!'. Measured, that
    // does not reject WR-07's OWN second example: ([a-z]+)+! survives a lowercase probe ending in
    // '!' because the greedy match SUCCEEDS immediately and never backtracks, and survives the digit,
    // mixed-alphanumeric and space-separated-word probes because none of them contains a long
    // lowercase run. Only a lowercase run with a different terminator rejects it.
    //
    // Hence three classes x two terminators. Every realistic user-pattern class — hex [a-f0-9],
    // base64 [A-Za-z0-9+/=], \w, [a-z], [A-Z], \d, \S, '.' — contains 'a', '1' or 'A', so each is
    // reachable by at least one probe under at least one non-matching terminator.
    //
    // NO WHITESPACE PROBE, deliberately, and this is a measurement rather than an omission. WR-07
    // proposed ("x"*50 + " ")*40 + "!". Eleven whitespace-targeting candidates were screened against
    // it — (x+ ?)+$, (x+ )+$, ([a-z]+ )+$, (\w+ )+$, ([a-z]+ )+#, (x+ )+@, (x+\s)+!, (\w+\s)+$,
    // (\S+\s)+$, ([a-z ]+)+#, ([a-z]+\s?)+# — and NOT ONE is rejected by that probe alone: the ones
    // it catches are already caught by the lowercase probes, and the rest are not catastrophic at
    // all, because a MANDATORY separator inside the group removes the ambiguity that drives the
    // blow-up. Adding it would have cost a probe's worth of worst case for coverage that could not
    // be demonstrated — the "named guard pointing at nothing" defect this round exists to close. If
    // someone later finds a genuine whitespace-only fixture, add the probe WITH that fixture.
    //
    // SIZING. The first entry is the original single probe, kept BYTE-FOR-BYTE, so no pattern
    // rejected before this widening changes verdict for an unrelated reason. Its note still holds
    // and applies to all six: on JDK 21 the classic (a+)+$ shape needs ~2 000 characters before the
    // 50 ms deadline fires (JDK 21's NFA engine handles shorter inputs without blow-up), so every
    // probe carries a run of that length.
    //
    // WORST CASE, stated rather than assumed: ADVERSARIAL_PROBES.size * DEFAULT_TIMEOUT_MS = 6 * 50
    // = 300 ms for ONE pattern, and it is only reachable by a pattern that is slow-but-completing on
    // five probes and pathological on the sixth. Measured reality: a pattern rejected by the sixth
    // probe cost 50 ms end-to-end, because the five it survives complete in microseconds.
    //
    // EDT NOTE — REPORTED, NOT FIXED HERE (T-21-67, Phase 23 / REL-05). isPatternSafe runs ON THE
    // EDT at save time via SettingsPanel.validateAndCollectCustomPatterns, so this widening
    // multiplies that path's worst case by the probe count. Phase 23 owns EDT confinement; this is
    // measured and reported there rather than restructured here. The startup seeding path in
    // App.initialize is NOT on the EDT-critical path.
