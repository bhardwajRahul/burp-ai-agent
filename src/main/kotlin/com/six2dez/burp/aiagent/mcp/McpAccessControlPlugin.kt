// SEC-04 / F1: the Ktor half of the MCP access-control gate. This file is the FIX for the bypass —
// the previous checks lived in an `intercept(ApplicationCallPipeline.Call)` block registered after
// `routing {}`, which put them behind RoutingRoot's own Call-phase interceptor, so every resolved
// route (including the SDK's /sse and /message) was served before they ran.
//
// `PluginBuilder.onCall` attaches to `ApplicationCallPipeline.ApplicationPhase.Plugins`, and
// `ApplicationCallPipeline` is constructed with the phases Setup, Monitoring, Plugins, Call,
// Fallback in that literal order. Both facts are fixed at pipeline construction, so this gate runs
// before routing REGARDLESS of where `install(McpAccessControl)` sits in the module lambda — the
// class of bug being fixed cannot recur through a future re-ordering of that lambda.
//
// All security logic lives in McpAccessControlDecision.kt and all observability lives behind
// [McpAccessControlConfig.onBlocked]; this file only adapts an ApplicationCall to RequestFacts.

/**
 * Lifts the attacker-controlled inputs out of the call. Values are kept RAW here: `evaluate` must
 * see what the client actually sent, and sanitization belongs to the log boundary (D-07).
 *
 * Uses `path()` and not `uri`, so a query string cannot change the [HEALTH_PATH] comparison.
 *
 * ## Why `host` is not just the `Host` header
 *
 * Reading only `headers["Host"]` made the whole local-mode DNS-rebinding branch dead code over
 * HTTP/2, in a user-reachable configuration: local mode with the independent "Enable TLS" option on
 * binds an `sslConnector`, Netty advertises `h2` over ALPN, and a foreign authority was measured
 * reaching `200` on `/__mcp/health` and `200` on `/sse` while the identical HTTP/1.1 request got
 * `403`. Two engine behaviours combine to cause it: Ktor 3.1.3 does not synthesise a `Host` header
 * from HTTP/2's `:authority`, and its Netty h2 request implementation builds the Ktor headers map by
 * iterating Netty's `Http2Headers` while SKIPPING any name whose first character is `:` — so every
 * pseudo-header is filtered out and `headers[":authority"]` is ALWAYS null. Reading the pseudo-header
 * from the headers map cannot work; the raw `Http2Headers` is not reachable either, because the class
 * holding it is declared `internal` in the Ktor module. The connection point is the only public seam
 * that surfaces `:authority` at all.
 *
 * The connection point is read through `local` rather than `origin` on purpose. `origin` resolves to
 * `attributes.getOrNull(MutableOriginConnectionPointKey) ?: local`, which means it becomes
 * client-controllable through `X-Forwarded-Host` the moment anyone installs `ForwardedHeaders` or
 * `XForwardedHeaders`. A DNS-rebinding gate must never read a client-overridable authority. The two
 * are the same object today (`KtorMcpServerManager` installs no forwarded-headers plugin); `local`
 * keeps that from silently becoming a bypass later.
 *
 * The fallback is gated to HTTP/2 and MUST STAY THAT WAY — do not "simplify" it by dropping the
 * version test. On HTTP/1.1 the connection point coalesces an ABSENT `Host` header into the server's
 * OWN listening socket, which is loopback: a raw HTTP/1.1 request carrying no `Host` at all was
 * measured yielding `serverHost = localhost` plus the bound port. Applying the fallback there would
 * hand the gate the server's own authority, pass the loopback check, and re-open the exact fail-open
 * being closed — a Host-less HTTP/1.1 request would go from denied to allowed.
 *
 * The port read is guarded because it can THROW rather than fail: the HTTP/2 connection point's port
 * getter calls `Integer.parseInt` on the substring after the first `:` with no exception handler, so
 * an attacker-supplied `:authority` such as `evil.example:abc` would raise `NumberFormatException` on
 * a Netty event-loop thread and surface as a `500` instead of a denial. On a guarded failure the
 * authority resolves to [UNRESOLVABLE_AUTHORITY], which the shared parser rejects — so the outcome is
 * a denial, and the audit payload plus the Output line get a diagnosable marker instead of a silent
 * allow.
 *
 * ## Residuals (accepted, all fail-closed except residual 1)
 *
 * 1. An HTTP/2 request with `:authority` ABSENT coalesces to the server's own socket and is therefore
 *    ALLOWED. This is not closable with Ktor's public API, because the raw `Http2Headers` sits behind
 *    a class the Ktor module declares `internal`, so absent and loopback-valued authorities are
 *    indistinguishable from here. RFC 9113 makes a request carrying neither `:authority` nor `host`
 *    malformed, so a conforming client and intermediary will not produce one.
 * 2. A bracketed IPv6 `:authority` is split on its FIRST colon by the HTTP/2 connection point, so
 *    `[::1]:9876` yields `[` and the original authority cannot be reconstructed — the request is
 *    DENIED. (The HTTP/1.1 connection point splits on the LAST colon and is bracket-safe, which is
 *    why this asymmetry exists at all.) `McpSettings.host` defaults to `127.0.0.1`, so this is
 *    reachable only for an operator who binds MCP to `::1` AND enables TLS AND uses an h2 client; the
 *    outcome is fail-closed.
 * 3. A PORTLESS `:authority` acquires the scheme's default port from the connection point, whose port
 *    getter falls back through `substringAfter(":", <defaultPort>)`. So HTTP/2 DENIES
 *    `:authority: localhost` — resolved as `localhost:443` over TLS, a port mismatch — where HTTP/1.1
 *    ALLOWS `Host: localhost` (empty port capture, null port, comparison skipped). Fail-closed, and a
 *    behavioural asymmetry between the two transports rather than a defect in either.
