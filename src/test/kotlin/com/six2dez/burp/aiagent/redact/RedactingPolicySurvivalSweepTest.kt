/**
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR.
 *
 * Plan 27-08 authored a must-have that read: "No green test asserting that a cookie value SURVIVES a
 * redacting policy is committed anywhere under `src/`." Its own repository falsified it. Two green
 * `assertTrue` assertions pinning a fixture hostname as surviving the strongest privacy mode were
 * sitting in `mcp/tools/McpToolHelpersTest.kt` at the time the claim was written, and a third pinned
 * a cookie sentinel as surviving in `redact/CookieHeaderNameParityTest.kt`. Nothing swept, so
 * nothing contradicted the claim.
 *
 * A green test is the most authoritative statement a repository makes about intended behaviour. A
 * green assertion that a sensitive value SURVIVES `PrivacyMode.STRICT` or `PrivacyMode.BALANCED` is
 * therefore a leak documented as a feature — it teaches the next audit that the leak is expected.
 * Plan 27-05 prohibited exactly that artifact, and this phase committed two of them anyway. A fourth
 * prose claim would be the fourth iteration of the same failure. This file is the claim made
 * MECHANICAL: it scans `src/test/kotlin` on every CI run and fails on the next such pin — written
 * with a plain or a backtick-quoted name, under any modifier prefix, with or without a same-line
 * annotation. NOT written with an opening parenthesis somewhere other than its declaration line;
 * that shape is blind axis 9 below, and this sentence is scoped rather than deleted because a
 * SCOPED TRUE claim is the artifact this phase exists to produce.
 *
 * That scoping was earned, not chosen. Until plan 27-15 the sentence was unqualified while the gate
 * admitted ONE optional modifier and a word-character name only: MEASURED, 133 of 1781 declaration
 * lines under `src/test/kotlin` were invisible — 67 of them backtick-named `@Test` methods across 9
 * files, one of them in this very package — and a synthetic survival pin scored 1 of 6 declaration
 * shapes. The claim was wider than the control, inside the file written to stop exactly that.
 *
 * WHAT THE SCAN CAN SEE — read this before quoting the file as evidence.
 *
 * One shape, and only one: an `assertTrue` whose `.contains(` argument is in the MEASURED sentinel
 * vocabulary of [SENSITIVE_VALUE_VOCABULARY], appearing inside a test function whose body names one
 * of [REDACTING_POLICY_MARKERS].
 *
 * WHAT THE SCAN CANNOT SEE. THIRTEEN axes — the value of [STATED_BLIND_AXES] — named because a
 * tripwire quoted wider than the vocabulary it scans reproduces, one iteration smaller, the
 * register-wider-than-control defect this whole phase exists to repair. That count is
 * MACHINE-CHECKED against this very enumeration by
 * [theStatedBlindAxisCountMatchesTheEnumeration]: it can go stale only if a test goes red first,
 * which is the property the previous eleven-axis claim did not have when it went stale.
 *
 *  1. A survival pinned with `assertEquals` rather than `assertTrue`.
 *  2. A survival pinned with the `in` operator instead of `.contains(`.
 *  3. A survival pinned with a regex find.
 *  4. A survival pinned with `assertNotNull`.
 *  5. A survival asserted through a helper defined in ANOTHER file, so neither token is in the body.
 *  6. A sensitive value that does not follow the measured naming convention and is not in
 *     [HOST_LITERALS].
 *  7. Anything above the unit suite — an integration run, a manual probe, a shipped log.
 *  8. A survival pin split across TWO functions: the policy marker in one, the assertion in another.
 *     The ISOLATION UNIT IS A WHOLE `fun` BODY, BLANK LINES INCLUDED, from the declaration line to
 *     the first non-blank line at or above its indent (in Kotlin, the closing brace). Function-scoped
 *     isolation is the chosen bound and this is what it costs.
 *  9. A survival pin on a declaration line whose OPENING PARENTHESIS does not follow the identifier
 *     on that same line. [FUNCTION_DECLARATION] requires it there, and [detect] returns early on a
 *     non-matching declaration line, so such a body is invisible ENTIRELY. Two shapes, both MEASURED
 *     on this tree after plan 27-15's widening: an EXTENSION RECEIVER (`private fun
 *     String.indentWidth()`) — 3 declarations, one of them in THIS file — and a MULTI-LINE SIGNATURE
 *     whose parenthesis sits on the next line, 0 today. This axis is the PRICE OF THAT WIDENING and
 *     it is named in the same change that created it, which is the discipline round 4 failed.
 * 10. A survival pin combined with a NEGATED containment inside ONE compound `assertTrue`.
 *     [assertsPresenceAt] computes negation from the `assertTrue(` opener to the containment under
 *     test, so where the FIRST operand is negated every later containment in the same assertion
 *     inherits that negation. `assertTrue(!a.contains(x) && b.contains(sentinel))` is therefore
 *     invisible. Unlike axes 11-13 this is an OVER-FIRE of a rule rather than the price of one.
 *     THE FIX, WRITTEN DOWN SO THE NEXT ENGINEER MEETS IT RATHER THAN RE-DERIVING IT: scope the
 *     negation test to the operand IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING the call, bounded by the nearest `&&`,
 *     `||` or comma, instead of to the whole span back to the opener. DELIBERATELY NOT APPLIED in
 *     round 5: the negation rule is load-bearing for 1 measured live hit and changing it without its
 *     own flip-pair fixture is how a detector gets quietly disarmed — the failure mode
 *     [theBenignExclusionCannotSwallowARealSentinel] exists to prevent for the other exclusion.
 *
 * The remaining three are the price of the three exclusions built into the detector. Each is stated
 * as a COST, not as a feature:
 *
 * 11. A survival pin whose text lives INSIDE a triple-quoted raw string. The FILE WALK skips those
 *     lines. That skip is not tidiness and it is not a self-file exclusion: EVERY fixture in this
 *     file is a verbatim copy of a real test function and therefore CARRIES ITS OWN `fun`
 *     DECLARATION LINE — that line is exactly what the isolation needs in order to isolate the
 *     fixture at all — and a line-based walk matches such a line inside a triple-quoted literal
 *     precisely as it matches one in code. Holding the fixtures at companion level does NOT prevent
 *     this; a line-based walk reads CONTENTS, not declarations. Without the skip this file flags
 *     ITSELF. The skip applies to every file the walk touches, and it is asserted non-vacuous in
 *     both directions by [theSweepFileItselfYieldsNoHits] and
 *     [theRawStringSkipIsWhyTheSelfScanIsClean] — and, since plan 27-15, in the FLAGGING direction
 *     too by [theWalkPreservesRealCodeWhileSkippingRawStringInteriors], which is the one that
 *     catches the skip growing to swallow real code.
 * 12. A survival pin positioned textually ABOVE the line that first names the policy. The POSITION
 *     RULE reads those as PRE-REDACTION FIXTURE GUARDS, because nothing has been redacted yet at
 *     that point in the body.
 * 13. A genuinely sensitive value reached through the one accessor named in [BENIGN_ACCESSORS].
 *
 * THE THREE EXCLUSIONS ARE CONSTRUCTED INTO THE DETECTOR, NEVER INTO [ALLOWLIST]. RE-MEASURED at
 * execution time in plan 27-15, running this detector — as WIDENED by that plan — over the 151 `.kt`
 * files of `src/test/kotlin`: the vocabulary WITHOUT the three exclusions reports 9 hits, every one
 * of them a LEGITIMATE shape — 7 benign-control assertions, 1 pre-redaction fixture guard, 1 negated
 * containment. WITH the three exclusions it reports 0. Run against the PRE-ROUND contents of the two
 * files that carried the pins, WITH the exclusions, it reports EXACTLY 3, and those 3 ARE the two
 * host pins and the underscore pin, under those same three identifiers.
 *
 * 9 / 7 / 1 / 1 / 0 / 3 are the numbers BEFORE the widening as well as after it. That equality is
 * the load-bearing part of the measurement, not a footnote: widening the declaration gate to 133
 * more declaration lines surfaced NOTHING new, so the widening bought scope without buying noise,
 * and nothing was narrowed to keep the hit set empty. Separately measured and stated because it is
 * easy to misread the 9: the raw occurrence count over the same population is 36, of which 27 are
 * `assertFalse` containments that are not candidates under ANY reading — the `assertTrue`
 * requirement is not one of the three exclusions, and counting them into the 9 would inflate the
 * exclusions' apparent cost by a factor of four.
 *
 * The 7 is stated as MEASURED HERE and not as inherited: plan 27-12 projected 5, which was the count
 * before plan 27-11 added two more JSON-string-open probes that each carry a benign-control
 * assertion. Re-measured again after plan 27-14, which added tests but no eighth benign-control
 * function: still 7, in 7 distinct live functions, all in `SerializedEmissionRedactionTest`. The
 * number is written down at what it actually is, because a stated bound wider or narrower than the
 * control it describes is the exact defect this phase exists to repair.
 *
 * Growing [ALLOWLIST] instead, or narrowing the vocabulary, is forbidden: both make an inconvenient
 * hit set empty without making the repository any safer.
 *
 * DURABLE CHECK versus ONE-TIME EVIDENCE, stated so the two are never confused. The in-file fixtures
 * below are the DURABLE check: they run on every CI run and they are what survives this phase. The
 * demonstration that this detector reports exactly three hits against the PRE-ROUND file contents
 * retrieved from git history is EXECUTION-TIME evidence, recorded in `27-12-SUMMARY.md` with its SHA,
 * its command and its raw output. It is NOT re-run by CI, deliberately: a `@Test` that shelled out to
 * git would make CI fail on repository history rather than on the code under test.
 *
 * This file is a TRIPWIRE OVER A MEASURED VOCABULARY, not a proof of coverage. A reader who quotes
 * it as proof of coverage reproduces the defect this phase exists to repair.
