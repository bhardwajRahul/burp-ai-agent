/**
 * (PRIV-05) Phase 27 plans 27-04 + 27-05 / D-27-13 — which redaction rules carry the logical-line
 * boundary, pinned from source.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR.
 *
 * Plan 27-04 taught three header rules that a JSON-escaped newline is a logical line start, by
 * routing them through ONE composer, `Redaction.logicalLineHeaderRule`. Because it is one composer,
 * a single token carries the whole claim: a rule that STOPPED using it, or a fourth rule that
 * STARTED, is a one-line edit that would otherwise be invisible in review.
 *
 * `hostHeaderRegex` is deliberately NOT in that set (D-27-13), and the reason is measured rather
 * than aesthetic: it rewrites through `anonymizeHost`, which records into the de-anonymisation map
 * that `RedactionHostMapBoundTest` exists to bound, and `SiteMapEntry.url` carries the same host
 * verbatim with no `maybeAnonymizeUrl` in front of it — so anonymising the header alone would
 * produce a control that reads as closed and is not. That exclusion is a DECISION, and a decision
 * that lives only in a SUMMARY drifts from the code the first time someone "fixes" it in passing.
 *
 * So this file asserts the composition and the record TOGETHER: the three rules that carry the
 * composer, the one that must not, and the rationale comment that has to keep naming the excluded
 * rule. A reader who finds the code and the record disagreeing has found a real regression.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS BOUNDED BY — read this before quoting it as evidence.
 *
 * It is a tripwire over FOUR NAMED RULES in ONE NAMED FILE, `redact/Redaction.kt`. A FIFTH rule with
 * the same blind spot, a rule in another file, or a header matcher that never reaches this file at
 * all is invisible to it and leaves it GREEN. It says nothing about whether the boundary is the
 * RIGHT one — the behavioural evidence for that is `SerializedEmissionRedactionTest` and
 * `RedactionTest`, not a source scan. `CookieHeaderRuleOwnershipTest` states its own bound in the
 * same place and for the same reason.

         *  4. an ARRAY ELEMENT open — `["Cookie: …` and `,"Cookie: …` — the ONE family this KDoc
