/**
 * (PRIV-05) Phase 27 plan 27-10. THE BOUND FIRST, BEFORE ANY ASSERTION — read this before quoting
 * this file as evidence of anything.
 *
 * This file measures ONE AXIS: the CHARACTERS either side of the literal token in a header NAME.
 * It answers "for a name built from character X, do [Redaction.isCookieHeaderName] and the two
 * cookie regexes inside [Redaction.apply] agree?" and nothing else.
 *
 * IT IS BLIND TO EVERY OTHER AXIS THIS PHASE HAS BEEN REFUTED ON:
 *  - the emission SHAPE — a header rendered as a JSON-escaped line, inside a quoted value, or in a
 *    re-emitted cookie SECTION rather than at column 0;
 *  - the parameter TYPE — the same bytes reaching a prompt as an `HttpParameterType.COOKIE`
 *    parameter rather than as a header at all;
 *  - the issue-detail RENDERING — the same bytes reaching a backend through `AuditIssue.detail()`.
 * Each of those refuted a previous round of this phase, and each is owned elsewhere.
 *
 * SO THIS FILE IS NOT EVIDENCE OF COVERAGE. It is a width check over one axis, and a reader who
 * cites it as proof that the cookie-header control is complete reproduces, one iteration smaller,
 * exactly the defect this phase exists to repair: a record wider than the control it describes.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES PIN, and this is the part with a shelf life longer than the phase:
 * [theCoveredSetIsReadFromRedactionSourceNotRetyped] READS the shipped `COOKIE_NAME_PART` character
 * class out of `Redaction.kt` and asserts it expands to exactly [COVERED_TCHARS]. Without that,
 * these three sets would be hand-typed copies asserted against each other — every test here would
 * stay green while [NOT_COVERED_TCHARS], the set `AR-27-10` is filed from, went quietly false.
