/**
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR.
 *
 * The v0.10.0 milestone audit found one security rule — "is this header a cookie header?" — with two
 * implementations that had drifted apart. Phase 21 widened the prompt path to name-CONTAINS-`cookie`;
 * the MCP tool-result path in `McpToolHelpers.sanitizeHeaders` kept comparing against the two
 * canonical spellings, so `X-Cookie`, `Cookie2`, `Set-Cookie2`, `X-Original-Cookie` and
 * `X-Forwarded-Cookie` reached an AI backend verbatim. Phase 27 promoted the rule to
 * [Redaction.isCookieHeaderName] and routed both header paths plus the passive-scan admitter through
 * it.
 *
 * An execution-time grep can only prove the tree was clean on the day someone ran it. This test makes
 * a FOURTH hand-written implementation fail CI instead, so the invariant outlives the phase that
 * created it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS BOUNDED BY — read this before quoting the test as evidence.
 *
 * The scan sees only the five spelling classes enumerated in [MATCHER_SPELLINGS]: exact-name
 * equality, `ignoreCase` equality, a line-prefix test, a Montoya `headerValue` lookup, and a
 * substring test. A cookie matcher spelled OUTSIDE those five classes — a `startsWith` on an
 * already-lowered name, an `in` operator against a set literal, a `when` branch, a name assembled
 * from a constant — is invisible to this scan and leaves this test GREEN.
 *
 * This test is therefore a TRIPWIRE OVER MEASURED SPELLINGS, not a proof of exhaustive coverage.
 * Anyone introducing a new spelling class must add it to [MATCHER_SPELLINGS], or the tripwire
 * silently stops covering their code. A reader who mistakes this tripwire for a proof reproduces,
 * one iteration smaller, the defect the whole phase exists to repair: a record wider than the control
 * it describes.
 *
 * The claim this file supports is scoped accordingly: there is exactly one cookie-header-name rule
 * across the two redaction paths and the passive-scan admitter. Other cookie-header-name matchers
 * survive in `src/main/kotlin` and are classified below as non-redacting, each with the reason read
 * from its own source and consumer.
