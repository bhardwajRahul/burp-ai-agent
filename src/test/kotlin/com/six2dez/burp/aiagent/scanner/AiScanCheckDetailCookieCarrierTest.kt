/**
 * (PRIV-05) Phase 28 plan 28-05 — `AR-27-08` ROUTE 2 (`CR-02`), the SECOND issue-detail cookie
 * carrier.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS. `AiScanCheck.buildDetail` is a second producer of active-scan
 * `AuditIssue.detail()` text, live-registered `PER_INSERTION_POINT` at `App.kt:214-215`, whose
 * output reaches the `scanner_issues` MCP tool result through `api.siteMap()`. Before plan 28-05 it
 * read NO privacy mode at all: `grep -n 'Redaction|PrivacyMode|RedactionPolicy|sanitize|privacyMode'`
 * over the file returned nothing, so it rendered a `PARAM_COOKIE` insertion point's `baseValue()`
 * identically under STRICT, BALANCED and OFF. This file measures the control that closes that.
 *
 * THIS IS THE FIRST TEST IN THIS REPOSITORY TO FAKE A MONTOYA `AuditInsertionPoint`. Measured at the
 * commit this file was written against: `grep -rl 'AuditInsertionPoint' src/test/kotlin/` listed
 * ZERO files. There was therefore no analog to copy, and the shape below is new rather than
 * borrowed.
 *
 * WHY THE OBVIOUS END-TO-END SHAPE IS UNAVAILABLE, stated so nobody "fixes" this file by rewriting
 * it as a `doCheck` test. `AuditIssue.auditIssue(...)` and `AuditResult.auditResult(...)` both route
 * through Burp's `ObjectFactoryLocator.FACTORY`, which is NULL outside the Burp runtime.
 * `AiPassiveScanCheckTest` — the only other test that drives a Burp `ScanCheck` — works around that
 * by CATCHING the resulting `NullPointerException` rather than by faking the factory. So this file
 * cannot reach `buildDetail` through the issue-construction path; it calls `buildDetail` directly,
 * which is why plan 28-05 widened that function from `private` to `internal`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE THEREFORE PROVES, and what it does NOT.
 *
 * PROVES: for the string `buildDetail` actually returns, a `PARAM_COOKIE` point's `baseValue()` is
 * absent under STRICT and BALANCED and present under OFF, measured through the REAL serialization
 * tail — `IssueDetails` -> `toolJson.encodeToString` -> `Redaction.apply` -> the extracted `detail`
 * field — with the pre-existing `Cookie:` header rule firing in the SAME output as a positive
 * control. Measuring through `Redaction.apply` is the point: `28-VERIFICATION.md` `missing[6]`
 * recorded that this shape had never been passed through the redactor, and an assertion on a bare
 * string would not have discharged it.
 *
 * DOES NOT PROVE: that the operator's configured privacy mode reaches `buildDetail` in production.
 * That link is the `getSettings()` call on `buildDetail`'s first line and the `App.kt:214-215`
 * wiring; no assertion here executes either. This is the same residual `IssueDetailCookieCarrierTest`
 * names for route 1, and it is stated rather than papered over.
 *
 * SENTINEL ISOLATION. Every sentinel here is DISTINCT from `IssueDetailCookieCarrierTest`'s. If the
 * two files shared one, a cross-class collision could make an absence assertion pass for entirely
 * the wrong reason, and the two files run in the same JVM.
 */
