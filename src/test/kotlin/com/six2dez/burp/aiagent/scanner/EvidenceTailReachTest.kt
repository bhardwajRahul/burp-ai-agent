/**
 * SC6 — the evidence tail of [ResponseAnalyzer], MEASURED rather than assumed.
 *
 * `VulnConfirmation.evidence` is built by concatenating a per-vuln-class signature label with a
 * MATCHED SUBSTRING of the response text, and `ResponseAnalyzer.analyze` builds that response text
 * from `headers() + "\n\n" + bodyToString()` (`ResponseAnalyzer.kt:619`). Response headers include
 * `Set-Cookie`, so a cookie value is inside the matched-against text. That is the reach question
 * this class answers in BOTH directions.
 *
 * WHAT THIS CLASS IS NOT. It is not a control. Phase 28 files this tail as residual `AR-28-01`;
 * nothing here redacts anything. These are measurements whose numbers feed that register row, plus
 * a drift tripwire so a fourth construction site — or a changed cap — turns this red instead of
 * silently invalidating the recorded severity.
 *
 * THE BOUND THE PRIOR RECORDS STATE IS WRONG. Both `.planning/ROADMAP.md` and
 * `CookieCarrierInventoryTest`'s RESPONSE_ANALYZER/HEADER_LIST disposition say the tail is "capped
 * at 80 characters", singular. The tree has THREE construction sites and they do not agree. This
 * class DERIVES the set from source; the pinned expectation below is a tripwire, not the source of
 * truth, and a derivation that disagrees with the pin is itself the finding.
