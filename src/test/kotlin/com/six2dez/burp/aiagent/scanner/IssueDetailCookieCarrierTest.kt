/**
 * (PRIV-05) Phase 28 plans 28-01 and 28-04 — `AR-27-08`, the issue-detail cookie carrier.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE MEASURES. A COOKIE-typed [InjectionPoint]'s `originalValue` is written into
 * `AuditIssue.detail()` by `ActiveAiScanner.createConfirmedIssue`, and leaves the product over MCP
 * as `IssueDetails.detail` (`mcp/schema/Serialization.kt:14`, the `scanner_issues` tool result).
 * Phase 27 MEASURED that route and applied no control: the disposition was TRANSFER, not mitigate.
 * These tests are the control's proof, and they carry their own attribution control, their own
 * positive control and their own non-vacuity guard so that a green result here cannot be produced
 * by some other rule.
 *
 * TWO DETAIL LINES ARE COVERED, NOT ONE. Plan 28-01 controlled `Original Value:`. Plan 28-04
 * controls `Payload Used:` one line below it, because for a COOKIE point production DERIVES the
 * payload from the injection point's value — `ActiveAiScanner.kt:511-515` hands
 * `target.injectionPoint.originalValue` to `PayloadGenerator.generateContextAwarePayloads`, which
 * interpolates it with no injection-type filter — so that line re-leaked the exact bytes the line
 * above had just stripped. `28-VERIFICATION.md` measured SC1 FALSE on precisely that gap.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE STILL DOES NOT COVER, so a green run is not over-read. `AiScanCheck.buildDetail`
 * is a SECOND active-scan detail producer in the repository and nothing here can see it; plan 28-05
 * owns it. No assertion in this file is a repository-wide single-producer gate — `WR-01` measured
 * that framing as false and D-28-06 keeps the real gate as a named residual.
 *
 * WHY THE MEASURED ROUTE IS BLIND TO THE REDACTOR (from 27-08-SUMMARY.md, not re-derived here).
 * `IssueUtils.formatIssueDetailHtml` joins the detail lines with `<br>`, so the blob carries NO
 * newline and the logical-line cookie rules have nothing to bind to. The rendered shape is
 * `Original Value: <value>`, not `name=<value> (COOKIE)`, so `Redaction.cookieTypedParamRegex`
 * cannot key on it either. The enclosing JSON key is `detail`, which is absent from
 * `SENSITIVE_WORDS`. The control therefore has to go at the WRITE site, keyed on the
 * [InjectionType] enum — the type-keyed discipline `McpToolHelpers.sanitizeParameters` states for
 * the sibling parameter carrier — because the write site is the last point in the route that still
 * holds the type at all.
 *
 * MOCKS-FREE BY CONSTRUCTION. Nothing here touches Montoya. The fixtures are built from the REAL
 * serializer types plus `toolJson`, never from a hand-typed escaped JSON envelope, so if the
 * emitted shape changes these tests move with it instead of quietly asserting against a shape that
 * is no longer emitted.
 *
 * SENTINEL DISCIPLINE. Both sentinels are low-entropy hyphenated lowercase words: no digits, no
 * `=`, no `.`, no `Bearer `/`Basic ` prefix, no regex metacharacter. So no entropy rule, no token
 * rule, no secret-key rule and no parameter rule can plausibly claim either of them. That claim is
 * not left as prose — [urlParamOriginalValueSurvivesStrict_attributionControl] PROVES it by
 * carrying the IDENTICAL sentinel on a URL_PARAM-typed point through STRICT and asserting it
 * survives. If some unrelated rule were doing the removal, that test would go red with the others.
 *
 * THE TWO SENTINELS MUST BE DIFFERENT STRINGS, not merely different variables.
 * [POSITIVE_CONTROL_COOKIE_VALUE] and [DETAIL_SENTINEL] are checked distinct and non-overlapping
 * in [BeforeEach], before any test body runs. This is load-bearing and the collision it prevents is
 * INVISIBLE IN A DIFF: `ScannerIssueSupport.INJECTION_VALUE_STRIPPED_MARKER` and the header rule's
 * marker are BOTH the literal `[STRIPPED]`, so a shared sentinel would let one substitution rewrite
 * both occurrences and leave the whole-blob difference enumeration with nothing to attribute.
 *
 * ## THE DESIGNATED RED PROBE — read this before mutating the control
 *
 * ONE DESIGNATED PROBE PER CONTROL, so a mutation is attributable to the gate it broke. If you
 * weaken `ScannerIssueSupport.sanitizeRenderedPayload`'s cookie branch, the assertion that is
 * SUPPOSED to catch you is the first `assertFalse` in [cookiePayloadIsStrippedUnderStrict] —
 * 28-04's designated red probe, whose three mutations are recorded verbatim in `28-04-SUMMARY.md`.
 *
 * If you weaken `ScannerIssueSupport.sanitizeInjectionPointValue`'s cookie branch, the assertion
 * that is SUPPOSED to catch you is the first `assertFalse` in
 * [cookieOriginalValueIsStrippedUnderStrict]. It is the designated red probe for that control.
 * [cookieOriginalValueIsStrippedUnderBalanced] and [cookieOriginalValueSurvivesUnderOff] go red
 * alongside it and are not redundant: the OFF one catches the opposite mistake, a control that
 * fires unconditionally.
 *
 * MEASURED 2026-08-27 by negating the branch condition — 7 of the 14 tests went red. Every
 * assertion that reads the COOKIE carrier's value under a policy-determined mode moved; the other
 * seven stayed green because none of them does. The seven that are BLIND to that mutation, and
 * therefore prove nothing about this control on their own:
 * [sentinelsAreDistinctAndNonOverlapping] (a fixture guard over two constants),
 * [urlParamOriginalValueSurvivesStrict_attributionControl] (a non-COOKIE type, green by design —
 * that is what makes it an attribution control), [theCookieHeaderPositiveControlFiresInTheSameStrictOutput]
 * and [theRequestResponsesListIsNotAlteredByTheControl] (both read `requestResponses`, which this
 * control never touches), [theCookieNameSurvivesEveryMode] (reads the NAME),
 * [theOriginalValueBoundIsDerivedFromTheConstant] (a non-COOKIE type again) and
 * [theWriteSiteReadsTheLivePolicy] (asserts over a DIFFERENT file's source text).
 *
 * A SECOND MUTATION, MEASURED SEPARATELY, because the two catch different mistakes. Dropping the
 * `Payload Used` line whenever the cookie gate fires — an OVER-MATCH that eats content PAST the
 * control's span, the regression class phase 27 round 4 shipped — turned exactly
 * [theStrippedDetailFieldRetainsEverythingAfterTheControlPoint] and
 * [theOnlyThreeDifferencesBetweenStrictAndOffAreTheEnumeratedControls] red while EVERY leak-only
 * assertion in this file stayed green. That is the measured reason those two guards exist: an
 * absence assertion is structurally unable to see content destruction.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE CANNOT CATCH, stated so a reader does not over-read a green run. Every BEHAVIOURAL
 * test here calls `ScannerIssueSupport.buildActiveIssueDetailLines` DIRECTLY. Nothing here executes
 * `ActiveAiScanner.createConfirmedIssue`, so no behavioural assertion proves the operator's
 * configured privacy mode actually reaches the gate. MEASURED: hard-coding that call site's policy
 * argument to `RedactionPolicy.fromMode(PrivacyMode.OFF)` left ALL EIGHT behavioural tests then in
 * this file GREEN. [theWriteSiteReadsTheLivePolicy] was added for exactly that gap and is the only
 * assertion that catches it; it is the source-TEXT pin standing in for coverage this file does not
 * have, and it is weaker than an execution assertion in a way the residual section of
 * `28-01-SUMMARY.md` names explicitly.
