/**
 * REL-07 / SC6 — the contract of the active scanner's per-request thread pool.
 *
 * **Naming constraint (hard).** `build.gradle.kts` excludes `*IntegrationTest`, `*ConcurrencyTest`,
 * `*BackpressureTest`, `*RestartPolicyTest` and `*SupervisionTest` under `-PexcludeHeavyTests=true`,
 * which is exactly what `.github/workflows/build.yml:47` passes. `ScanRequestExecutorTest` is the
 * approved name; the natural `ScanRequestConcurrencyTest` ends in an excluded suffix and would have
 * removed this suite from the PR gate silently.
 *
 * **Nothing here starts a scanner.** Every assertion is on the factory, on a locally-constructed
 * executor built from the same arguments as the production site, or on source text. No
 * `ActiveAiScanner` is constructed and `setEnabled(true)` is never called, so the suite is fast and
 * cannot leak a live scanner.
 *
 * **Comment stripping in the structural assertions is load-bearing, not cosmetic.** The production
 * file explains this exact pool shape in prose, naming the very tokens counted here — an unstripped
 * reader would score a KDoc mention of a cached pool as a cached pool and invert the gate.
 *
 * **This suite reads source from disk,** so `build.gradle.kts` declares `inputs.dir("src/main/kotlin")`
 * on `tasks.test` under the property name `mainSourceTreeStructuralInputs` (plan 24-01). Without it,
 * reverting the pool shape can leave a cache key close enough that the test task is served from
 * cache and these guards never run, in exactly the commit that breaks them.
 *
 * **No test here compares an elapsed duration to a threshold.** The saturation boundary is proved by
 * latch handshakes whose failure mode is a categorical [assertTimeoutPreemptively] timeout.
