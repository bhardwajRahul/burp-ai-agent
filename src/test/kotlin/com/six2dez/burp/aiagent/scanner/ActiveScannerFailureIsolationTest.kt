/**
 * REL-06 / SC2 (plus the SC1 x SC6 coupling) — per-target fault isolation in [ActiveAiScanner].
 *
 * **Naming constraint (hard).** `build.gradle.kts` excludes `*IntegrationTest`, `*ConcurrencyTest`,
 * `*BackpressureTest`, `*RestartPolicyTest` and `*SupervisionTest` under `-PexcludeHeavyTests=true`,
 * which is exactly what `.github/workflows/build.yml:47` passes. `ActiveScannerFailureIsolationTest`
 * is the approved name; the natural `ActiveScannerBackpressureTest` and
 * `ActiveScannerConcurrencyTest` forms both end in an excluded suffix and would have made this suite
 * silently stop running on the PR gate.
 *
 * **What is actually red here, stated so nobody over-claims it.** SC2's first clause — "the scanner
 * keeps processing its queue after an induced failure on one target" — is already TRUE in the
 * pre-fix code, because the per-target `try/catch/finally` inside `processQueue` predates this
 * phase. An assertion on that clause alone passes both before and after the fix and therefore
 * proves nothing. The assertion that genuinely goes red pre-fix is the log-content one
 * (`theFailureLogLineNamesTheTargetItFailedOn`): the old message was
 * `[ActiveAiScanner] Error: <exception message>` and carried no target identifier at all. The two
 * are asserted as a pair; only the second is a gate.
 *
 * **The fault-injection lever is the constructor's `getSettings` lambda.** It is called at exactly
 * one place — the first line of `executeScan`, which runs on a scan worker thread — and is NOT
 * called by `queueTarget`. No new production seam was added for this suite.
 *
 * **No test here compares an elapsed duration to a threshold.** Progress is awaited by polling a
 * monotone counter inside [assertTimeoutPreemptively], whose failure mode is a categorical timeout
 * rather than a wall-clock comparison.
 *
 * **Every test that calls `setEnabled(true)` leaks a live scanner unless it is shut down.** The
 * `@AfterEach` below does that for all of them; `ActiveScannerDedupTest` does not, and that part of
 * it is deliberately not copied.
 *
 * **Reflection here touches this project's own class only** (`ActiveAiScanner`'s private `executor`
 * field and its private `processQueue` method). Nothing reflects into `java.base`, which on JDK 21
 * would raise `InaccessibleObjectException` under this build's `--add-opens`-free test JVM.
