/**
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR.
 *
 * Phase 27 (D-27-17) deliberately REFUSED to convert `InjectionPointExtractor.kt`'s hand-written
 * `it.type().name == "COOKIE"` filter to the shared [com.six2dez.burp.aiagent.redact.Redaction]
 * predicate, and wrote the reason into `Redaction.isCookieParameterType`'s KDoc: while the
 * issue-detail route the extractor feeds was still uncontrolled, swapping the predicate would have
 * produced a tidier file and an unchanged leak — a route that merely LOOKED addressed.
 *
 * Plan 28-01 controlled that route at its write site
 * ([ScannerIssueSupport.sanitizeInjectionPointValue]). Plan 28-02 then collected the conversion.
 * That commit falsifies the predicate COUNT the KDoc pinned, so this file re-derives the count from
 * the tree instead of letting a new number be restated in prose where it would go stale silently.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS BOUNDED BY — read this before quoting the test as evidence.
 *
 * The scan sees only the four spelling classes enumerated in [COOKIE_TYPE_COMPARISONS]: literal
 * equality/inequality in either operand order, an `equals("COOKIE"` call, and equality against the
 * owner's `COOKIE_PARAMETER_TYPE_NAME` constant. Two constructs are OUTSIDE that population BY
 * DESIGN, and naming them here is what keeps the count honest:
 *
 * 1. `InjectionPointExtractor.matchInsertionPoint`'s `when (param.type().name)` maps all THREE
 *    Montoya type names (`URL`, `BODY`, `COOKIE`) to [InjectionType] values. That is a three-way
 *    dispatch, not a cookie predicate. Converting only its COOKIE arm would leave a `when` whose
 *    arms are spelled two different ways — less readable than either consistent form — so plan
 *    28-02 left it, and a bare `"COOKIE" ->` arm is therefore not counted here.
 * 2. `Redaction.COOKIE_PARAMETER_TYPE_NAME`'s own `= "COOKIE"` declaration is a DECLARATION, not a
 *    comparison. Counting the owner's constant would make the owner look like a duplicate of itself.
 *
 * Comment lines are stripped before matching. A `grep -c`-style count over unstripped source would
 * count the very supersession comments plan 28-02 writes — which is exactly how a header becomes
 * self-invalidating. Stripping is by LINE PREFIX — a line-comment marker, a KDoc continuation star,
 * or a block-comment opener — so a comparison hidden behind a TRAILING comment on a code line is
 * still seen, while a comparison spelled outside the four classes is not.
 *
 * This is a TRIPWIRE OVER MEASURED SPELLINGS, not a proof of exhaustive coverage. Anyone adding a
 * new spelling class must add it to [COOKIE_TYPE_COMPARISONS], or the tripwire silently stops
 * covering their code.
