/**
 * The forward-only claim, AT ITS TRUE SCOPE.
 *
 * NARROWED 2026-08-28 (phase 28 UAT test 2, closing `28-REVIEW-3.md` WR-05). This was previously the
 * blanket sentence `Applies from now on, not retroactively`, which is FALSE for the dominant path —
 * `McpToolContext.redactIfNeeded` re-redacts every MCP tool result under the CURRENT mode, so for
 * ordinary captured traffic a switch to STRICT *is* retroactive. Scanner findings are the only
 * genuinely forward-only case, so the pin moves onto the half-sentence that says so with its scope
 * attached. The claim is still pinned; it is no longer pinned in a form the product contradicts.
 *
 * WHY THE SUBJECT IS PART OF THE NEEDLE. The first draft of this pin was the bare predicate
 * `keep the values they were built with`, which does not carry its own subject — so
 * `Recorded findings and captured requests keep the values they were built with` would have
 * satisfied every test in this file while reintroducing the exact over-broad claim the narrowing
 * removed. The negative pin below catches only the LITERAL retired sentence, not a reworded one.
 * Including `Scanner findings already recorded` makes the SCOPE part of what is pinned, which is
 * the thing that actually matters here. Found by the round-4 verifier reviewing this file's own
 * change; the earlier form was not a regression (the pin it replaced mandated the false sentence)
 * but it was a tripwire that did not reach as far as its test name implied.

/**
 * (PRIV-05) Phase 28 plan 28-07 — the WRITE-TIME/READ-TIME BOUND, pinned where an operator meets it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. `D-28-09` accepted, as a named residual, that both cookie controls decide
 * ONCE at issue construction and bake the result into the immutable `AuditIssue.detail()` string, so
 * a finding built while `privacyMode` was `OFF` still emits the raw cookie value on a later STRICT
 * read, and `AiScanCheck.consolidateIssues`'s `KEEP_EXISTING` means a re-scan does not repair it.
 * `D-28-10` made that acceptance CONDITIONAL on the bound being NAMED — including at the one surface
 * where an operator states an intent about redaction. [PRIVACY_MODE_TOOLTIP] is that surface, and
 * this file is what stops the naming from being a one-round gesture the next copy edit removes.
 *
 * WHY THE CONSTANT EXISTS AT ALL. The tooltip was previously an inline literal inside
 * `SettingsPanel.initUiWiring()`, an extension function needing a live `SettingsPanel`, so it was
 * unreachable from a unit test. Extracting it to an `internal` top-level constant is what makes the
 * string the panel shows and the string this file asserts THE SAME OBJECT rather than two copies
 * that can drift apart. The source-scan test below is what keeps them from drifting back.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DOES NOT PROVE. It does not prove an operator READ the tooltip, and it does not
 * prove the bound is fixed — the bound is a residual, not a closed defect. It proves only that the
 * copy naming it is present, is reachable from the single assignment site, and is ADDED to the
 * purpose sentence rather than substituted for it.
