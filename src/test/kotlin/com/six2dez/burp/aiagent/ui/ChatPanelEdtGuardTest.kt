/**
 * QUAL-07 / SC4 — `ChatPanel`'s EDT check says what it actually does, and keeps saying it.
 *
 * **This suite is structural on purpose, and the purpose is the decision behind it.** SC4 asked for one
 * of two honest end states for `ChatPanel.assertEdt()`: a mechanism that reports inside a shipped Burp,
 * or source that states plainly that it does not. Phase 26 plan 26-04 selected the second
 * (`document-test-only`); `26-04-SUMMARY.md` § `SC4 decision` carries the selection verbatim along with
 * the measurement it was taken against. So there is no new runtime behaviour to assert here — the whole
 * deliverable is the wording, and wording is exactly the kind of thing that rots silently.
 *
 * **Why a test rather than a comment.** The state SC4 exists to end is not "the check is weak"; it is
 * "the check reads as a guarantee it does not provide". That gap opened once already, through ordinary
 * drift: the helper is named `assertEdt`, its summary line claimed it asserted EDT-ness, and the call
 * site at `maybeExecuteToolCall` said the rule was "enforced by assertEdt() under -ea" — while the JVM
 * disables the debug-time assertion facility in every Burp a user actually runs. Nothing stops that
 * wording coming back except an assertion that fails when it does.
 *
 * **What this suite does NOT claim.** It does not claim the EDT-confinement invariant is enforced in
 * the field, because under the selected option it is not. The invariant is held by the marshalling
 * discipline at the callers and proved by `ChatPanelEdtConfinementTest`; this file only pins the
 * honesty of the surrounding prose. Anyone reading these assertions as safety evidence has read them
 * backwards.
 *
 * **Naming constraint (hard).** `build.gradle.kts` excludes `*IntegrationTest`, `*ConcurrencyTest`,
 * `*BackpressureTest`, `*RestartPolicyTest` and `*SupervisionTest` under `-PexcludeHeavyTests=true`,
 * which is what `.github/workflows/build.yml`'s PR gate passes. Any of those suffixes here would make
 * this suite nightly-only. Do not rename this class into one of them.
 *
 * `ChatPanel.kt` is covered by `tasks.test`'s `inputs.dir("src/main/kotlin")` declaration, so these
 * assertions really do re-run when the source text changes even when the bytecode does not — the 22-09
 * stale-cache defect. No build-file change is needed to make that true.
