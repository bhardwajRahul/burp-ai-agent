/**
 * SEC-06 / SC2: proves the trust-typography rules of `ToolApprovalCard` mechanically.
 *
 * These run headless because `build.gradle.kts` passes `-Djava.awt.headless=true` (plan 22-01). A real
 * Swing card is constructed, walked and clicked — no model of the card, and no modal, which is one of
 * the reasons D-06 rejected a dialog: `JOptionPane.getRootFrame()` throws `HeadlessException`, so a
 * modal decision surface would be untestable in CI.
 *
 * Note for anyone reading `ChatPanelConcurrencyTest`: its KDoc claims a real Swing component cannot be
 * constructed headless. That premise was measured false in Phase 22 Wave 0. Do not model these
 * assertions on that file.
 *
 * **What is deliberately NOT asserted here:** pixel positions, colours and fonts. Those are the human
 * UAT items in `22-HUMAN-UAT.md`. What is asserted is structure, widget class, text content and callback
 * wiring — which is what actually carries the security property.
 *
 * **Naming constraint (hard).** `build.gradle.kts` excludes `*IntegrationTest`, `*ConcurrencyTest`,
 * `*BackpressureTest`, `*RestartPolicyTest` and `*SupervisionTest` under `-PexcludeHeavyTests=true`,
 * which is exactly what the PR gate passes. This file must keep the plain `Test` suffix.
