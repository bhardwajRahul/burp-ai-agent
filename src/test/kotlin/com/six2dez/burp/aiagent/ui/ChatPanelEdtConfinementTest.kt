/**
 * REL-05 / SC1 · SC2 · SC3 — an approved tool call runs OFF the AWT Event Dispatch Thread.
 *
 * **This file drives a REAL [ChatPanel] through its REAL Send button and its REAL approval card**, via
 * [ChatPanelTestHarness]. Nothing about the dispatch path is modelled: the assertions read a `Thread`
 * the production code actually created, captured inside the deep-stub `MontoyaApi` at the moment the
 * tool body ran.
 *
 * **Naming constraint (hard), inherited from [ChatPanelTestHarness]'s own KDoc.** The PR gate runs
 * `./gradlew test -PexcludeHeavyTests=true` (`.github/workflows/build.yml:47`) and
 * `build.gradle.kts:206-213` excludes `*IntegrationTest`, `*ConcurrencyTest`, `*BackpressureTest`,
 * `*RestartPolicyTest` and `*SupervisionTest` under that flag. `ChatPanelConcurrencyTest` already sits
 * in the excluded set, which makes `*ConcurrencyTest` the natural — and silently fatal — name to reach
 * for here. `ChatPanelEdtConfinementTest` is the approved one. Do not rename this class.
 *
 * **No assertion in this file compares an elapsed duration to a threshold.** Every timeout present is a
 * deadlock failsafe whose margin over the work is four orders of magnitude — categorically unlike the
 * `RedactionTest` wall-clock flake, where a 50 ms deadline bounds work of the same order.

     * `status=error` with a 112-character error result before any EDT question arises: its body reaches
     * Montoya's `HttpRequest.httpRequest` static factory, which `McpScopeFilter.deriveScopeUrl`'s own
     * KDoc already records as *"unavailable in pure-JVM unit tests"*. The assertion would then be red
     * for a reason that has nothing to do with the EDT, which is the one thing a red-before-green gate
     * must never be. `proxy_http_history` is the same trust boundary through a seam that works.

     * removing that one line turns it red.** Session delete is the ONE teardown exit of four that does
     * not route through `cancelInFlightRequest`, so it inherited nothing from plan 23-01's supersede
     * cell (research F-5). Without the explicit `runningTool.take()` in `deleteConfirmedSession` the
     * returning worker finds its token still current, takes the SUCCESS branch, files an `"ok"` run
     * for a session that no longer exists, and sends a followup turn continuing that dead chain.
     *
     * **Two clauses are loud and two are not, and which is which was MEASURED against the reverted
     * tree rather than assumed.** Loud: the recorded run status (`"ok"` with the defect present), and
     * the `supersedeReason` key, which only the superseded exit merges onto the pair. Corroboration
     * only:
     * - the missing transcript row — `ToolCallCapture` freezes the `SessionPanel` OBJECT before
     *   dispatch, and a deleted session's panel is DETACHED rather than destroyed, so the row really
     *   is written on the un-superseded tree, into a panel [transcriptText] can no longer reach;
     * - the turn count — `sendMessage` returns early when `sessionPanels[sessionId]` is null
     *   (`ChatPanel.kt`), and a session delete removes exactly that entry, so the followup the success
     *   branch asks for is refused one layer further down whether or not the supersede happened.
     *
     * Both stay, because both are the claim for a supersede whose panel SURVIVES — the unload exit
     * below is one — and neither may ever be promoted to carry this test on its own.
     *
     * **`deleteConfirmedSession` rather than `deleteSession`, and the modal was not deleted to get
     * here.** `deleteSession` opens `JOptionPane.showConfirmDialog`, which constructs a `JDialog` and
     * throws `HeadlessException` under `-Djava.awt.headless=true`; every line of the teardown sits
     * below it. Production keeps the confirmation in one function and the teardown in another, so
     * this drives the real teardown while real users still meet the real modal.

     * `McpRuntimeContextFactory`. Two chat calls can therefore never contend today. The dimension
     * exists to catch the FUTURE refactor that hoists that construction out of `buildToolContext` "to
     * avoid an allocation" and silently couples two independent user actions. If the string below ever
     * reaches a chat transcript, a limiter became shared and it is a real defect.
     *
     * **`maxConcurrentRequests = 1` is what gives the negative clause teeth.** The baseline is 4, and
     * two concurrent calls would fit inside a SHARED limiter of 4 without complaint — so against the
     * baseline this test would pass under the very refactor it exists to catch. With one permit, a
     * shared limiter refuses the second call after its 250 ms `tryAcquire` and writes the exhaustion
     * string into the transcript.
     *
     * **What this scenario does NOT claim, measured rather than glossed:** that the chain survives.
     * The running-tool supersede cell is panel-wide by design, so the `/tool` command takes the token
     * and the chain's in-flight step lands in state S4 — no row, no followup, chain over. That is
     * correct behaviour, asserted below rather than worked around. It is also barely reachable by a
     * real user: the panel is in state S3 while a tool runs, with Send hidden and the input disabled,
     * so only this harness can type into it. The paired structural guard is
     * [theChatToolLimiterIsConstructedPerCall], which does not depend on any of that.
