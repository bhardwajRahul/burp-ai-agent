/**
 * REL-07 / SC6 — the contract of the extension-wide worker pool (`App.workerPool`).
 *
 * **Naming constraint (hard).** `build.gradle.kts` excludes `*IntegrationTest`, `*ConcurrencyTest`,
 * `*BackpressureTest`, `*RestartPolicyTest` and `*SupervisionTest` under `-PexcludeHeavyTests=true`,
 * which is exactly what `.github/workflows/build.yml:47` passes. `WorkerPoolExecutorTest` is the
 * approved name. Both natural alternatives for this subject are traps: `WorkerPoolSupervisionTest`
 * (this pool is owned by `AgentSupervisor`'s restart path) and `WorkerPoolRestartPolicyTest` (its
 * contract is about what happens on saturation) each end in an excluded suffix, and either would
 * have removed this suite from the PR gate silently while still passing locally.
 *
 * **Nothing here constructs an `App` and nothing spawns a real service process.** Every assertion is
 * on the factory, on a locally-constructed pool built from the same arguments as the production site,
 * or on source text. The suite needs no live Burp and no `ollama serve` on the machine running it.
 *
 * **Comment stripping in the structural assertions is load-bearing, not cosmetic.** `App.kt`
 * deliberately explains this pool's shape in prose and names the two rejected alternatives —
 * including a cached pool and a caller-runs policy — right above the construction. An unstripped
 * reader would score that explanation as the very construction it forbids and invert the gate.
 *
 * **This suite reads source from disk,** so `build.gradle.kts` declares `inputs.dir("src/main/kotlin")`
 * on `tasks.test` under the property name `mainSourceTreeStructuralInputs` (plan 24-01). Without it,
 * reverting the pool shape can leave a cache key close enough that the test task is served from cache
 * and these guards never run, in exactly the commit that breaks them — the measured 22-09 defect.
 *
 * **No test here compares an elapsed duration to a threshold.** Concurrency is proved by latch
 * handshakes whose failure mode is a categorical [assertTimeoutPreemptively] timeout.
