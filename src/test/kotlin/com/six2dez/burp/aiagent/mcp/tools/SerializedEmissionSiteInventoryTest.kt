/**
 * (PRIV-05) Phase 27 plan 27-05 / D-27-14 — the emission-site inventory, pinned by measurement.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS FOR.
 *
 * Phase 27 exists because a privacy control was verified at the one site it was written for and
 * never compared against its siblings. The set of MCP tool-result sites that serialize a raw HTTP
 * message into a JSON string was never enumerated: the phase verifier cited 12 such sites, the UAT
 * note cited 10, and both were partial. A number nobody measured is a number nobody can defend, and
 * "did we get them all?" stayed a review question when it should have been a test result.
 *
 * This file converts it into a test result. The inventory is measured, declared as named constants,
 * and asserted. A fifteenth site, a site that exists in one executor and not the other, or a fourth
 * tool-registration path all read as a DATA CHANGE here — visible, deliberate, and reviewable —
 * rather than as silence.
 *
 * WHAT MAKES A RULE-LEVEL FIX REACH EVERY SITE. None of the 14 emission sites redacts anything
 * itself. `McpToolLegacy.kt`'s seven all sit inside `mcpPaginatedTool<…>` registrations, which
 * delegate to `mcpTool<I>` (`McpTool.kt:82`), whose handler wraps its output in
 * `context.redactIfNeeded(` (`McpTool.kt:45`). `McpToolExecutorImpl.kt`'s seven all sit inside the
 * dispatch `when` whose result is wrapped at `McpToolExecutorImpl.kt:1037`. That is why changing a
 * regex in `redact/Redaction.kt` reaches all 14 — and it is asserted below from source rather than
 * argued in prose.
 *
 * ── BOUND 1, on the EMISSION-SITE scans (count, per-file split, tool-name presence, choke point) ──
 *
 * They recognise ONE MEASURED CALL SHAPE: `encodeToString(it.toSerializableForm(` /
 * `encodeToString(it.toSiteMapEntry(`. An emission site written in a DIFFERENT SHAPE — a serializer
 * called through a local variable, a hand-built JSON string, a third serializable carrier with a
 * new conversion function — is invisible to every scan in this file and leaves it GREEN.
 *
 * The per-file split, the tool-name presence check and the choke-point assertion are additionally
 * scoped to the TWO NAMED EXECUTOR FILES in [EMISSION_EXECUTOR_FILES]. `theMeasuredEmissionSiteCountIsPinned`
 * does scan all of `src/main/kotlin` for the call shape, so a site added in a THIRD file fails that
 * one assertion — but the shape bound above still holds over the whole tree, and the other three
 * scans still see only two files.
 *
 * ── BOUND 2, on the REGISTRATION-PATH scan, which is a DIFFERENT AND WEAKER BOUND ──
 *
 * `everyToolRegistrationPathReachesTheChokePoint` covers ALL of `src/main/kotlin` for one call name,
 * `addTool(`. But it proves choke-point reachability only for the DELEGATION SHAPE AS WRITTEN: it
 * asserts that `McpToolHandlers.registerToolHandler`'s handler calls
 * `McpToolExecutor.executeToolResult(` and carries no wrapper of its own. A future handler that KEPT
 * that call and ALSO serialized and emitted its own payload beside it would still pass. A tool
 * registered through some mechanism other than `addTool(` is invisible to it entirely.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS FILE IS, THEREFORE ──
 *
 * A TRIPWIRE OVER A MEASURED INVENTORY, not a proof of coverage. Nothing here says every path that
 * can reach an AI backend is redacted. A reader who quotes it as such reproduces, one iteration
 * smaller, the defect this phase exists to repair: a record wider than the control it describes.
 * `CookieHeaderRuleOwnershipTest` states its own five-spelling bound in the same place and for the
 * same reason.
