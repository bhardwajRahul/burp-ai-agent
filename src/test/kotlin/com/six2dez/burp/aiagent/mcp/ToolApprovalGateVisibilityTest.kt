/**
 * SC5 / CR-02 regression guard: the model origin can only be minted from inside [ToolApprovalGate].
 *
 * **Why this test exists, stated plainly.** CR-02 found `approvedOrigin` shipped as `internal`, which
 * in Kotlin is MODULE-wide — any file in the main source set could write
 * `ToolApprovalGate.approvedOrigin(SecTier.AUTO, ToolDecision.AUTO)` and hand the result straight to
 * `McpToolExecutor.executeTool` with no card, no session-memory consultation and no audit record. A
 * module-wide factory for a file-private type is simply a module-wide factory. It was narrowed to
 * `private`, and the compiler does enforce the current state — but **widening it back compiles cleanly
 * and, until this file existed, failed nothing.** Phase 22's verification recorded that as WARN-6, and
 * its reasoning is the reason this is not deferred: the control had already regressed once, silently,
 * while ADR-15 asserted the property anyway. The other three code-review fixes each shipped with a
 * regression test; this is the fourth.
 *
 * **Two independent channels, because neither alone is sufficient.**
 *
 * 1. *Source text.* The only option for [MODEL_ORIGIN_CLASS]: Kotlin has no file-private JVM
 *    visibility, so a top-level `private class` and an `internal` one are not reliably distinguishable
 *    after compilation in a way worth asserting on. Reading the declaration is what the property
 *    actually says. The pattern — read a repo file from disk, assert on its text — is
 *    `DecisionsAdrTest`'s, and so is the obligation that comes with it: **`GATE_FILE` is declared as a
 *    `tasks.test` input in `build.gradle.kts`.** Without that declaration Gradle cannot infer a file
 *    read at runtime, a comment-only edit produces byte-identical compiled output and therefore an
 *    identical cache key, and the test task is restored from cache with the guard never running — the
 *    exact defect plan 22-09 found and fixed for `DecisionsAdrTest`.
 * 2. *Bytecode.* For [FACTORY] the compiler's own output can be checked, and it is the stronger
 *    statement: not "the source says private" but "the compiler emitted a private method". Kotlin
 *    mangles an `internal` member's name with the module name, so widening changes both the modifier
 *    and the emitted name — this assertion sees either.
 *
 * A source-text guard is a weak instrument in general. It is the right one here because the property
 * being pinned IS a visibility keyword, and because the alternative on offer is no guard at all.
