/**
 * SEC-07 / SC2 — Finding 7, asserted against a real hostile listener.
 *
 * The scenario is the one the finding describes: a local process binds `127.0.0.1:<mcp port>` before
 * Burp does, answers `GET /__mcp/health` with `200` **and a spoofed `X-Burp-AI-Agent: mcp` response
 * header**, and waits for the extension's bind-conflict takeover to hand it something. Before Phase 25
 * it was handed `Authorization: Bearer <token>` — full MCP tool access to the operator's Burp.
 *
 * The squatter here is `okhttp3.mockwebserver.MockWebServer` — the legacy package, matching the
 * existing in-repo call sites in the backend tests.
 *
 * Naming note, inherited verbatim from `McpTestServerSupport.kt`: test classes in this package MUST
 * NOT be named `*IntegrationTest`, `*ConcurrencyTest`, `*BackpressureTest`, `*RestartPolicyTest` or
 * `*SupervisionTest`. The `excludeHeavyTests` filter block inside `tasks.test` in `build.gradle.kts`
 * excludes exactly those globs under `-PexcludeHeavyTests=true`, so a security gate wearing one of
 * those suffixes would be silently skipped in a fast PR gate and prove nothing.
