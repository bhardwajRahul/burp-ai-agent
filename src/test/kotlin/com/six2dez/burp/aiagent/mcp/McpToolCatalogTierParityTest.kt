 * That is the entire point: a computed expectation would follow any edit silently, whereas a literal
 * turns promoting a tool to a laxer tier into a deliberate, reviewed diff. This closes the fragility
 * recorded in `.planning/codebase/CONCERNS.md` §"MCP unsafe-tool gate — new tools must opt in",
 * where forgetting to classify a new tool handed it the permissive behaviour by default.
