/**
 * Behavioural tests for the pure helpers in `McpToolHelpers.kt`.
 *
 * Phase 26 plan 26-02 (QUAL-06 / SC2). The four helpers covered here carry privacy and trust
 * decisions on the MCP tool-RESULT path, which is a second redaction path independent of
 * `Redaction.redact`:
 *
 *  - `sanitizeHeaders` — the header redactor (T-26-02-01).
 *  - `maybeAnonymizeUrl` — STRICT-mode host anonymisation of tool-result URLs (T-26-02-02).
 *  - `resolveReportPath` — the containment check between a model-supplied report path and an
 *    arbitrary filesystem write location (T-26-02-03).
 *  - `applyReplacements` — the payload substitution used by the repeater payload tools.
 *
 * Header fixtures are mockito mocks rather than `HttpHeader.httpHeader(...)`: the Montoya static
 * factory dereferences `burp.api.montoya.internal.ObjectFactoryLocator.FACTORY`, which is null
 * outside the Burp runtime, so the factory NPEs in a unit test. This mirrors the existing
 * `InjectionPointExtractorTest`.
