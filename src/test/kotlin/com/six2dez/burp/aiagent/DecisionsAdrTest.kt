 *
 * **What this test can do.** It is a string-match guard. It stops ADR-15 from disappearing, stops it
 * from silently losing D-05's `AUTO` sentence in a later edit, and — the part that carries the real
 * value — asserts that the ADR's copy and the [com.six2dez.burp.aiagent.mcp.SecTier] KDoc's copy still
 * say the same thing. Two divergent copies of the inherited rule is the failure mode here; a match
 * against one copy alone would not catch it, because the drift would simply move into the other.
 *
 * **What this test cannot do.** It cannot judge whether ADR-15 is *factually accurate* — whether the
 * threat model it records matches shipped behaviour, and whether it claims only what ships (D-14).
 * That is judgement, not a string match, and it is assigned to a human in
 * `.planning/phases/22-agent-tool-call-trust-boundary/22-HUMAN-UAT.md` test 2. Neither half is
 * sufficient alone: an ADR is the one success criterion that is easy to mark done without checking,
 * which is why SC1 carries both a cheap automated guard and an explicit human reviewer.
