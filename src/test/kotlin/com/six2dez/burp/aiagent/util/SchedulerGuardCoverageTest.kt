/**
 * REL-06 / SC1 — the structural half of the scheduler guarantee.
 *
 * Phase 23 D-02 ratified the shape: the guarantee lives in two places at once. [GuardedSchedulingTest]
 * proves the mechanism works; this suite proves every recurring schedule in the codebase actually
 * uses it. A helper nobody is required to call is a helper the sixth call site will skip.
 *
 * **Naming constraint (hard).** `build.gradle.kts` excludes `*IntegrationTest`, `*ConcurrencyTest`,
 * `*BackpressureTest`, `*RestartPolicyTest` and `*SupervisionTest` under `-PexcludeHeavyTests=true`,
 * which is exactly what `.github/workflows/build.yml:47` passes. `SchedulerGuardCoverageTest` is the
 * approved name precisely because the natural one — `SchedulerSupervisionTest` — ends in an excluded
 * suffix and would have made this guard silently stop running on the PR gate.
 *
 * **Comment stripping is load-bearing, not cosmetic.** The guarded files name the very tokens counted
 * here in their own KDoc and inline comments, so a reader that did not strip comments would count
 * documentation as a call site. It is also what makes it safe for `GuardedScheduling.kt` to explain
 * the failure mode in prose.
 *
 * **This suite reads source from disk.** `build.gradle.kts` therefore declares
 * `inputs.dir("src/main/kotlin")` on `tasks.test` under the property name
 * `mainSourceTreeStructuralInputs`. Without it, adding an unguarded scheduler can produce a cache key
 * close enough that the test task is served from cache and this guard never runs — in exactly the
 * commit that breaks the invariant (the measured 22-09 defect).
