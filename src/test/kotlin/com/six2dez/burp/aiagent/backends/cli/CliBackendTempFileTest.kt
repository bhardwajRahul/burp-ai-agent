/**
 * REL-07 / SC5 — the acceptance suite for [CliTempFileRegistry], the bounded live-file registry that
 * replaces the JDK's per-invocation exit-time deletion registration in `CliBackend` (CONTEXT.md D-01
 * through D-04).
 *
 * **Naming constraint (hard).** `build.gradle.kts` excludes `*IntegrationTest`, `*ConcurrencyTest`,
 * `*BackpressureTest`, `*RestartPolicyTest` and `*SupervisionTest` under `-PexcludeHeavyTests=true`,
 * which is exactly what `.github/workflows/build.yml` passes on the PR gate. `CliBackendTempFileTest`
 * is the approved name and does not match any of them — recorded here because
 * `CliTempFileRegistryConcurrencyTest` is the natural name for a suite that drives a thread-safe
 * registry and would have made this suite silently stop running on the PR gate.
 *
 * **What this file replaced, and why it was replaced rather than inverted.** Two tests named
 * `uvPromptDeleteOnExitIsRegistered` and `codexOutputDeleteOnExitIsRegistered` used to live here with
 * a reflective helper that read the JDK's internal exit-hook file set. They were measured vacuous, not
 * blocking: each created its OWN temp file under a different prefix, neither referenced `CliBackend`
 * at all, and the helper's reflection raises `InaccessibleObjectException` on the project's JDK 21 —
 * a `RuntimeException`, which the helper's own `catch (_: Exception) { true }` converted into a pass.
 * They were incapable of ever failing. SC5 therefore had zero real coverage before this rewrite.
 *
 * **No test in this file reflects into `java.base`.** That technique is dead on every JDK 16 and
 * later and fails open by construction; `24-VALIDATION.md` §Assertions Explicitly Ruled Out records
 * it. The registry is `internal` (D-02) precisely so its state is directly observable in pure JVM,
 * with no subprocess and no reflection.
 *
 * **The two surviving tests are a control only in the weakest sense.** `uvPromptTempFileIsCleanedUpAfterFailure`
 * and `codexOutputTempFileIsCleanedUpAfterFailure` create and delete their own files and prove that
 * `File.delete()` in a `finally` block works. They are NOT coverage of `CliBackend`'s own `finally`
 * path — nothing here drives that code. They are kept because they still pin the shape D-01 preserves
 * and they must stay green across this rewrite, which is a useful regression signal and nothing more.
