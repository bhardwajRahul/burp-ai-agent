/**
 * REL-07 / SC3 / SC4 — the behavioural acceptance suite for [CliOutputBuffer].
 *
 * **Naming constraint (hard).** `build.gradle.kts` excludes `*IntegrationTest`, `*ConcurrencyTest`,
 * `*BackpressureTest`, `*RestartPolicyTest` and `*SupervisionTest` under `-PexcludeHeavyTests=true`,
 * which is exactly what `.github/workflows/build.yml` passes. `CliOutputBufferTest` is the approved
 * name; `CliOutputConcurrencyTest` would have been the natural one for a suite that races eight
 * writers against two readers, and it would have made this suite silently stop running on the PR gate.
 *
 * **No test here spawns a subprocess and no test here compares an elapsed duration to a threshold.**
 * The buffer is drivable in pure JVM, so a real CLI process would add flake without adding evidence.
 * The concurrency test's failure mode is a deadlock or a lost thread, which
 * [assertTimeoutPreemptively] reports categorically.
 *
 * **The anti-corruption test is the one that matters most.** `CliBackend`'s success path reads the
 * FULL accumulated value and that value IS the model's answer, not a diagnostic tail; only the two
 * error paths take a 2000-character head. A cap set anywhere near that figure would silently corrupt
 * every CLI backend's output, and [aFiftyThousandCharacterAnswerRoundTripsByteIdentically] is what
 * makes that regression red.
