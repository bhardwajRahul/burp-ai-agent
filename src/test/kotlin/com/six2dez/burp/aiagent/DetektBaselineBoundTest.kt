 * The `<ID>` count sealed by phase 26 plan 07, which trimmed the baseline from 1096 entries to this
 * number with a removals-only diff.
 *
 * This is a CEILING, not a target. ADR-17 clause 1 says the baseline may lose entries and may never
 * gain them, so the only edit this constant is ever allowed to receive is a DOWNWARD one, made in the
 * same commit as the removals that earned it. Raising it to make a build green converts a finding
 * somebody would otherwise have had to answer into a finding nobody will ever see again — which is
 * precisely the inversion ADR-17 clause 1 exists to forbid.

/**
 * QUAL-07 / SC3 gate on ADR-17 clause 1 — "`detekt-baseline.xml` shrinks and is never appended to".
 *
 * **Why this exists.** ADR-17 states the shrink-only rule in prose and [DecisionsAdrTest] asserts that
 * the ADR still names the file, but neither one can observe the file's actual size. The one command
 * that could — `git diff -U0 <ref>..HEAD -- detekt-baseline.xml | grep -c '^+.*<ID>'` — lived inside a
 * plan document and ran once. A contributor who hits a new detekt finding and baselines it away
 * therefore breaks a written rule that nothing in `./gradlew check` is watching. This test is that
 * watcher.
 *
 * **What it can do.** It counts `<ID>` entries on disk and fails when the count exceeds the sealed
 * ceiling. That catches the whole failure mode the rule is about: appending an entry rather than
 * fixing the finding.
 *
 * **What it cannot do.** It cannot tell a removal-plus-addition pair that leaves the count level from
 * an honest no-op, and it cannot judge whether a removal was backed by a real source fix or by a stale
 * entry. Direction over a range of commits stays a `git diff` question; the count is what a build can
 * hold. The two are complementary, and neither substitutes for the other.
 *
 * **Cache note.** `build.gradle.kts` declares `detekt-baseline.xml` as an input of `tasks.test`. Without
 * that declaration a commit touching only the baseline produces byte-identical compiled output, the
 * test task is served from the build cache, and this guard reports green in exactly the commit that
 * breaks it. Do not remove the declaration.
